HasComments
===========

This is plug in for Ruby on Rails that aims to provide simple commenting on
ActiveRecord models. At the time of writing this is very much a work in
progress.


Example
=======

You can apply this plugin in your models like this:

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_comments
  end

Commenting on that post is now enabled.

See the inline documentation for more information.
